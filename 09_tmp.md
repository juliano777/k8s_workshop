# Job

A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created.

A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).

You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.
Running an example Job
Here is an example Job config. It computes Ï€ to 2000 places and prints it out. It takes around 10s to complete.

vim sleeper.yaml


```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: sleep
spec:
  completions: 1
  parallelism: 15
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sleeper
        image: alpine
        command: ["sleep", "30"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

You can run the example with this command:

kubectl apply -f sleeper.yaml
